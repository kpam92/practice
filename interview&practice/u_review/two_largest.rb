# Given an array, return the two largest numbers in it
# Note. This is the largest and second largest INSTANCE.
# This means that if the largest number shows up twice,
# we return it twice.

# highest_two([1,2,4]) ==> [2,4]
# highest_two([4,1]) ==> [1,4]
# highest_two([1]) ==> [nil,1]
# highest_two([]) ==> []
