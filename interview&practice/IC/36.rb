# To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffled_deck is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.
#
# We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 1..521..52 (since there are 5252 distinct cards in a deck).


def riffle?(deck, half1,half2)
