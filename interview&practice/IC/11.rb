# I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillionâ„¢.
# I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.
#
# Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents' basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of memory because visited is getting so huge.
#
# How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?


# Thought: to clear up space, create a TRIE, where we store each variable that
# may lead up to a visited link

    @head = Node.new("*",nil)

    idx = 0

        curr_node.insert(link[idx])
      end
      curr_node = curr_node.children[link[idx]]
