# You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.
# Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backwards! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.
#
# Write a function reverse_words() that takes a string message and reverses the order of the words in-place â†´ .
