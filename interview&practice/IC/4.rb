# Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
# To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as arrays ↴ of integers [start_time, end_time]. These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
# Write a function merge_ranges() that takes an array of meeting time ranges and returns an array of condensed ranges.

def merge_ranges(ranges)
