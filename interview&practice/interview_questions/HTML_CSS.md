##### CSS

* What is the difference between classes and ID's in CSS?
<br><br> Both are selectors for elements on the page, but usually you have more classes on a page, while ID's are used for singular elements. An ID is a more specific selector than a class. This is a good article on css-selector specificity : https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/
* What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
<br><br>Normalizing means to make a consistent look and feel of document styles for various browsers, while resetting is to clear the default CSS style of DOM elements.
* Describe Floats and how they work.
<br><br> Floats are `left`, `right`, and `none`. A float will take the element out of its original flow and pushes it to the direction specified.
* Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
<br><br> The z-index indicates the position of the element as it stacks on top of other elements. It's best to think of the elements as pieces of paper on top of each other. An element with a higher z-index will be higher up on the stack and presumably more visible to the viewer.
